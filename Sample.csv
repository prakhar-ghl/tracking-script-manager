This is Nazia with HighLevel, and I will assist you today. Please allow me a few minutes to review your request. 12:48 AM, 21st Apr Ahsan Ali sure 12:49 AM, 21st Apr Nazia In GoHighLevel, the ""Edit"" option for domain settings allows you to link a domain (root or subdomain) to a funnel or website. This is typically found under ""Settings"" > ""Domains"" within your sub-account. The edit option lets you specify which funnel or website should be associated with that domain, effectively setting the root or subdomain to point to that specific page 12:51 AM, 21st Apr Nazia i found this for you https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000734-how-to-use-the-domain-connect-feature- 12:53 AM, 21st Apr Nazia hope this helps let pls let me know if you need any further assistance with the same 12:53 AM, 21st Apr Ahsan Ali there is no edit option in this ghl, it is not showing 12:54 AM, 21st Apr Ahsan Ali Normally it shows like this: 12:55 AM, 21st Apr Nazia Yes so are you not able to view it under the edit tab? 12:55 AM, 21st Apr Ahsan Ali no it just shows delete option, no edit option 12:56 AM, 21st Apr Nazia The Edit Button Might Be Missing: Initial Domain Addition: The Edit button is visible only when you first add the domain. Once you've associated it with a funnel or website, the option to edit the default page is no longer available in that section. This design ensures that each domain has a single default landing page. Purchased Domains via GHL: If you've purchased the domain directly through GoHighLevel, you can manage DNS records and configurations within the platform. Navigate to** Subaccount > Settings > Domains > Purchased Domains**, then click Configure next to your domain to edit DNS records or connect the domain to a site. 12:57 AM, 21st Apr Nazia Allow me some more time i am checking your account. were you able to view the edit button early on ? and it disappeared now? 12:58 AM, 21st Apr Nazia In GoHighLevel (GHL), if the ""Edit"" button is missing in the Domains section (which is normally used to set a funnel or website as the default on the root domain), here are the main reasons why this might happen: ✅ 1. The Domain Has Already Been Assigned Once a domain is connected and already assigned to a funnel or website, the ""Edit"" option might no longer show up because: The domain is already in use. The platform assumes you've already completed the setup. ?️ Fix: You’ll need to remove the domain and re-add it if you want to reassign it through the Edit interface. ✅ 2. You're in the Wrong Place Make sure you're in the Sub-account (not the agency level) and go to: Settings → Domains You should see your domain listed here. If you added it correctly and it's not currently in use, you should see an ""Edit"" button on the right. ✅ 3. You Added the Domain as a Subdomain The ""Edit"" button only appears for root domains, not subdomains. Example: ✅ mydomain.com → can have Edit ❌ funnel.mydomain.com → won’t show Edit ✅ 4. Domain Not Fully Verified Yet If the DNS records (A/CNAME) haven’t propagated yet, GHL might not let you edit or assign the domain. ?️ Fix: Double-check your DNS settings: Root domain: A record → 162.159.140.166 Subdomain: CNAME → sites.ludicrous.cloud Make sure Cloudflare (if used) is set to “DNS Only” (not proxied). ✅ 5. Bug or Glitch Occasionally, the Edit button might not appear due to a UI glitch. ?️ Fix: Try: Logging out and back in. Switching browsers. Clearing cache. Checking from incognito/private window. ? If You Still Don’t See It: You can manually assign the domain to a funnel/website: Go to your Funnel or Website. Click Settings. Under Domain, choose the domain from the dropdown. Save. This way, you're effectively setting the funnel or site to load on that domain — even if you don’t see the ""Edit"" button. 01:04 AM, 21st Apr Nazia please let me know if you need any further assistance regarding the same 01:04 AM, 21st Apr Take to Team Inbox",Pending,2025-04-21 01:05:04,No Product,Domains,Connecting/Adding Domain,Add/remove Funnel/Website Domains,Domains,,Ahsan Ali,,,chriscarpediem25@gmail.com,https://www.helloprojectusa.com/,2024-12-30 00:00:00 UTC,agency_monthly_497,"0-390-131 - HelloProject USA, LLC","",,

Let me pull up the account here on my end 12:23 PM, 21st Apr Eric Bobrow Admin Bobrow FYI - we have set up a Dedicated Sending Domain of mg.triskelionmusic.com however the link in the email (which was a simple Instagram page) goes to a URL starting with email.mg.triskelionmusic.com. 12:24 PM, 21st Apr Dran Did you delete your dedicated domain just now? 12:24 PM, 21st Apr Eric Bobrow Admin Bobrow no 12:24 PM, 21st Apr Dran 12:25 PM, 21st Apr Dran It changed just now 12:25 PM, 21st Apr Dran Is someone working on this? 12:25 PM, 21st Apr Eric Bobrow Admin Bobrow No, I just opened up the page to look at it. When I looked at the Domain page it seemed ok. 12:27 PM, 21st Apr Dran It seems like someone is making some changes to your dedicated domain, and its causing the links in the email to not work properly 12:28 PM, 21st Apr Dran Domain is not verified 12:29 PM, 21st Apr Eric Bobrow Admin Bobrow Now when I go to the Domains page it says it needs verification. I will go through the process. 12:29 PM, 21st Apr Dran Yes please, Check if the records in your hosting provider are still there 12:29 PM, 21st Apr Dran Once the dedicated domain is verified and back to normal, links within the email should work properly 12:32 PM, 21st Apr Eric Bobrow Admin Bobrow I have verified the domain, let me try clicking the links. 12:34 PM, 21st Apr Dran But I suggest giving it time for the records to fully propagate to the whole internet 12:34 PM, 21st Apr Eric Bobrow Admin Bobrow The link works now! 12:34 PM, 21st Apr Dran AWESOME!!! 12:34 PM, 21st Apr Eric Bobrow Admin Bobrow Did something change in your system so now all subaccounts have to be updated?

I will help you in the best possible way today.  Please allow me a moment to look into it before I start troubleshooting. ? 09:58 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica Thank you for patiently waiting. About your 1st question, To update the name servers for a domain purchased in Go High Level and add it to Cloudflare, you'll need to first update the domain's name servers at your registrar (Go High Level) to point to Cloudflare's servers, and then verify the DNS records at Cloudflare. 2nd question, Yes, GHL likely offers the ability to build and manage an affiliate program for products like your widget. You can likely create a custom affiliate network, track affiliate links, manage commissions, and more within the GHL platform. 10:04 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David hi 10:04 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David ok I realize the name servers need to be updated, but I was unable to find the option to do that? Can you elaborate on how to actually do that, like what are the steps in the system. and for #2, ""likely"" is something I already aqssumed before I asked, that isnt very helpful. I need to know YES we can do it and where to go for the resources please if you know 10:06 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica 1st: Here's the article for more information https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000734-how-to-use-the-domain-connect-feature- 10:08 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David okay thank you, but there isnt anything about name servers in there 10:09 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica 2nd: Here's the article for more information https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001202637-how-to-use-affiliate-portal 10:09 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David or did I miss it? I couldnt find the word name or server anywhere 10:09 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David Okay, Ive been through that affiliate stuff, that is all about being an affiliate of Go High Level , not how to affiliate your own product. 10:10 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica This is related to the servers, and it actually depends on your domain host. 10:10 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David ok, the reason I am asking support is because I need support, meaning someone that can give me the answer. Are you able to get me to someone that can if your unable to pleaqsew 10:11 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica If you’d like to get more information about the Affiliate program, you can reach out to our Affiliate Support team. https://speakwith.us/affiliate 10:13 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David Okay you cant get a yes or no from anyone? 10:13 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica Let’s focus on one question at a time to avoid any confusion. :) 10:15 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David and with a domain that was purchased inside the domain area of go high level can you please ask someone or how to update the naqme servers, or tell me if it cant be done. 10:15 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David ok. please which ever you like. 10:16 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica Kindly follow the steps on the article https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004674-configure-connect-purchased-domains the answer to your question is actually already right there in what you asked. 10:19 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David ok let me see 10:20 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David no it doesnt. It only talkes about DNS records. I am asking if we can change the name servers. Which means we would point it to cloudflare and the DNS would be managed there. 10:22 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David unless I missed it do you see program name servers tere? I do miss things constantly ? 10:23 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica Thank you for waiting. You can definitely do that—it just depends on the domain host you’re using. 10:26 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David ok the host is GHL if we bnouth it in GHL right? 10:26 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica Yes, correct! 10:28 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David so, how, is my question, inside go high level do i change my name servers please 10:29 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David this is what it looks like what do I do from here 10:29 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica Just to confirm, which server are you referring to? 10:34 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David I have no idea what your asking me, I have a customer who purchased a domain inside there and wants to update the name servers and Im trya help them. Is thee a place that shows ""server"" info? 10:40 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David this doesnt say anything about name servers either 10:42 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica Here’s how it works—once something is set up, it won’t change unless it’s manually updated. 10:43 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David Where do you update the name servers manually my dear Maria? 10:44 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica In Domain host :) 10:45 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David this has been the worst experien ce in my entire business life getting going with GHL 10:45 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica Apologies for the inconvenience Christopher 10:46 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David Apology accepted. Now, what your trying to dsay is ""I dont know "" but it seems hard to get it out the right way. You are unable to show me or provide me with how to update the name servers most likely because it cant be done. Clearly you have no idea. and also the same with the affiliate stuff. No clue. 10:49 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David and thats cool but you should just say "" I have no idea "" 10:50 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica I do have an idea about your concern—that’s exactly why I’m helping you, so I can explain it clearly to you. 10:51 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica I also send articles for more information 10:51 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David yes the effort is A+ but it should be as easy as YES or No and if yes heres how, but the docsw are outdated and dont mention what IUm asking about 10:52 PM, 21st Apr Christopher David I appreciate your effort but you need to understand time is money and Im sitting here wasting my time getting no where and its likw 7 out of 10 when I try to interact with GHL. Its unreal and frustrating. I appreciate your effort. Thank you! 10:53 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica Sorry about that :( 10:54 PM, 21st Apr Maria Jessica You're welcome Christopher David, glad I was able to help!
